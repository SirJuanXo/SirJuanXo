- 👋 Hi, I’m @SirJuanXo an amateur programmer. My name is Juan but I use JuanXo as my nickname in honor of my teacher of Maths.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python packages as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Selenium... and others to create shorts or big codes to run whatever I need in my Chemistry career.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tkinter (finishing), Numpy and Selenium (at the moment).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever project that could be related with Chemistry and Maths overall.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me a direct message to my IG juan_lu_7

- So here we are, learning and sharing, thanks to science to make our lifes easier.
